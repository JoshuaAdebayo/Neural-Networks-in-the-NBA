# Notebook Title
Neural Networks in the NBA
## Overview
This repository holds my final year Data Science Individual Project (dissertation). I experiment with Neural Networks and Multivariate Logistical Regression to assess if ML is capable of being used within the NBA draft
## Contents
- Introduction to the raw data
- Extensinve data cleaning/manipulation
- Dimensioanlity Reduction - PCA 
- Models: Multi-Layered Perceptron (Neural Network) & Multivariate Logistical Regression
- Model Results & Interpretation: Standard evaluation metrics used (f1-score, recall, precision, accuracy) and shapley values used to bring deeper insight to the models
